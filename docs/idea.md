# MyShopiStar - AR NFT Marketplace

## Problem Statement

### The Phygital Commerce Disconnect in Kenya

Kenyan artisans, small businesses, and individual sellers face significant challenges in the digital commerce landscape:

#### Core Business Problems
- **Limited Buyer Confidence**: Inability to verify product authenticity and quality before purchase
- **Ineffective Product Visualization**: 2D images fail to convey product details, leading to high return rates
- **No Digital Ownership Trail**: Physical goods lack verifiable ownership history and provenance
- **Geographic Limitations**: Unique local products struggle to reach wider markets
- **Trust Deficit**: No secure escrow system protecting both buyers and sellers
- **Logistical Challenges**: Inefficient delivery systems with unpredictable pricing and tracking

#### Technical Challenges
- **3D Model Generation Barrier**: Converting 2D product images to high-quality AR models is complex and resource-intensive
- **Blockchain Integration Complexity**: NFT minting, gas fees, and wallet management present significant UX hurdles
- **AR Performance Inconsistency**: Varying mobile device capabilities across the Kenyan market
- **Payment System Fragmentation**: Bridging traditional M-Pesa with blockchain transactions
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Protection against modding, hacking, and fraudulent activities
- **Infrastructure Limitations**: Network variability affecting real-time AR and blockchain operations

#### Market-Specific Challenges
- **Digital Literacy Gap**: Complex blockchain and AR concepts intimidate first-time users
- **Device Fragmentation**: Wide range of smartphone capabilities across different price points
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Evolving stance on cryptocurrencies and digital assets in Kenya
